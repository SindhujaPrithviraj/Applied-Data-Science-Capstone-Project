# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
The Final Capstone Project for the IBM Data Scientist Professional Course - Spacex analysis and model building

## Introduction

In this capstone project, the objective is to make predictions on the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX offers rocket launches on their website, priced at 62 million dollars, significantly lower than other providers whose costs can reach 165 million dollars per launch, mainly due to the reusability of the first stage. By accurately determining the landing outcome, we can estimate the cost of a launch, which can be valuable information for competing companies interested in bidding against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Business Problem

This cost reduction is mainly attributed to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Consequently, accurately predicting the probability of a successful first stage landing enables the determination of launch costs. Leveraging the insights and models derived from utilizing Data Science techniques, what are certain factors that may affect the landing outcome?
